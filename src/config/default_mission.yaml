# DEFAULT MISSION CONFIGURATION
# ==============================
# This file defines a default research mission template.
# Users can copy and customize this for their specific research needs.

# MISSION METADATA
# ----------------
mission:
  # Human-readable mission name
  name: "Example Research Mission"

  # Research topic or question
  # This will be passed to the Planner Agent to decompose into tasks
  topic: "AI-powered wildfire detection and containment systems"

  # Mission type (affects how the Planner strategizes)
  # Options: research, monitoring, analysis, trend_tracking
  type: "research"


# SOURCE CONFIGURATION
# --------------------
sources:
  # Specific URLs to fetch (optional)
  # If empty, the Planner Agent will need to discover sources
  urls:
    - "https://example.com/wildfire-ai-article"
    - "https://example.com/thermal-imaging-drones"

  # Maximum number of sources to fetch
  # The Planner will prioritize and select up to this many
  max_sources: 5

  # Allowed domains (optional whitelist)
  # If specified, only sources from these domains will be used
  allowed_domains:
    - "example.com"
    - "research.org"

  # Blocked domains (optional blacklist)
  blocked_domains:
    - "spam.com"


# PROCESSING PREFERENCES
# ----------------------
processing:
  # Summary style
  # Options: technical, executive, casual
  summary_style: "technical"

  # Desired summary length
  # Options: brief (1-2 paragraphs), medium (3-5), detailed (full analysis)
  summary_length: "medium"

  # Extract structured data (keywords, entities, dates)
  extract_metadata: true

  # Content quality threshold (0.0 - 1.0)
  # Sources scoring below this will be skipped
  min_quality_score: 0.5


# OUTPUT CONFIGURATION
# --------------------
output:
  # Output format
  # Options: markdown, plain, html, json
  format: "markdown"

  # Save raw HTML for debugging

  notion_page_id: "YOUR_NOTION_PAGE_ID_HERE"


# LOGGING & DEBUGGING
# -------------------
logging:
  # Log level: debug, info, warning, error
  level: "info"

  # Save mission to SQLite archive
  archive_mission: true

  # Include detailed timing information
  include_timings: true


# TEACHING NOTES
# --------------
# This YAML file demonstrates configuration-driven design.
# Users can modify mission behavior without touching code.
#
# In Phase 2, the Flow Controller will read this file and
# use it to configure the entire pipeline.
#
# In Phase 5, we'll add support for multiple mission templates
# (wildfire research, hardware security, etc.)
